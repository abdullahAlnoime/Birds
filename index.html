      <h3>Covered with <span>Feathers</span></h3>
      <p>Feathers are the outer covering of birds' bodies. Feathers isolate birds from water and low temperatures, and color can be used as camouflage against predators and sometimes as a means of visual communication. Although individual feathers are very light, the weight of a bird's feathers is two or three times greater than its skeleton</p>

      <h3>Birds Lay <span>Eggs</span></h3>
      <p>Female birds lay eggs and continue incubating them for a certain time. Also, the number of eggs changes from one species to another, ranging from one egg, as in the condor bird, and up to seventeen, as in the gray partridge, and its color is usually white because of the calcium carbonate that makes up the shell, But some birds may produce colorful eggs</p>

      <img src="./images/Skeleton.svg" alt="Skeleton icon" />
      <h3>Light <span>Skeleton</span> and <span>Beak</span></h3>
      <p>The skeleton of the bird combines strength and lightness. One of the signs of the strength of the bird’s bones is the fusion of many of its bones together in places that are usually articulated in other vertebrate animals. The vertebrae of the trunk are almost fused to each other</p>

      <p>The homing instinct in birds and animals is one of their most remarkable traits: their strong local attachments and their skill in finding their way back when removed to a distance. It seems at times as if they possessed some extra sense - the home sense - which operates unerringly.</p>
